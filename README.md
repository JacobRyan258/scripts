# CityCoins Scripts

This directory provides a set of Node.js scripts and utilities to interact with the CityCoins protocol.

All functions are documented using [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started.html), and the documentation lives on [GitHub Pages](https://citycoins.github.io/scripts).

To learn more about a specific script, click on the link below.

| Name                                                  | Description                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| [`autominer.js`](./info/autominer.md)                 | Utility for continously mining CityCoins          |
| [`autominingclaimer.js`](./info/autominingclaimer.md) | Utility for claiming CityCoin mining rewards      |
| [`getstackinginfo.js`](./info/getstackinginfo.md)     | Get the current Stacking info for a given address |

All of the scripts use [prompts](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts) to gather the required information, and nothing is stored on disk.

For scripts that use a private key, remember to **keep it safe** and **never share with anyone**. [This page has more information](./info/privatekey.md) on how to obtain your hex encoded private key for scripts that require it.
